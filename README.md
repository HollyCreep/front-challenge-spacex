## Technologies Used

Usually I use Routes and Vuex in my projects, but I decided to keep the project as simple as possible.
I like to use Vuetify for styling and to speed up development on my projects, however I dont have any problem learning and working with other libraries.

This was the first time I worked with GraphQL and I really liked it. I intend to study it more and go deeper into it.

## Improvements
Depending on the demand and growth of the project, I would choose to use routing and state control with Vuex. 
I would also like to style the project more, I am very perfectionist and I love beautiful interfaces and implement tests, which I am studying at the moment, but I still donâ€™t have confidence to use them yet.

If I had more time, I would definitely learn more about Graphql and Apollo and improve the layout.
## Project setup
```
npm install
```
